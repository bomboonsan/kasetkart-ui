# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the entire Strapi connectivity layer from REST API to GraphQL implementation. The migration must be 100% complete with zero errors and follow GraphQL best practices for querying, mutations, and data fetching patterns. The system currently uses REST endpoints for all Strapi operations including user management, research data, publications, projects, funding, and administrative functions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace all REST API calls with GraphQL queries and mutations, so that the application uses a unified GraphQL interface for all Strapi operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use GraphQL client instead of REST API client
2. WHEN any data fetching operation occurs THEN the system SHALL use GraphQL queries with proper field selection
3. WHEN any data mutation operation occurs THEN the system SHALL use GraphQL mutations with proper input validation
4. IF a REST API call exists THEN the system SHALL replace it with equivalent GraphQL operation
5. WHEN GraphQL operations execute THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the application flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement GraphQL best practices for query optimization, so that the application performs efficiently and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing GraphQL queries THEN the system SHALL only request required fields to minimize data transfer
2. WHEN implementing queries THEN the system SHALL use fragments for reusable field selections
3. WHEN handling related data THEN the system SHALL use proper query structure to avoid N+1 problems
4. WHEN implementing mutations THEN the system SHALL use proper input types and return appropriate response data
5. WHEN caching is applicable THEN the system SHALL implement proper cache strategies for GraphQL responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work seamlessly after the migration, so that there is no disruption to the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access any page THEN all data SHALL load correctly using GraphQL
2. WHEN users perform CRUD operations THEN all operations SHALL work without errors
3. WHEN users navigate between pages THEN the application SHALL maintain the same performance characteristics
4. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the GraphQL client SHALL properly handle authentication tokens
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized GraphQL client configuration, so that all GraphQL operations are consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL configure a single GraphQL client instance
2. WHEN GraphQL operations execute THEN the system SHALL use consistent headers and authentication
3. WHEN configuring the client THEN the system SHALL support both development and production environments
4. WHEN handling responses THEN the system SHALL have consistent error handling across all operations
5. WHEN implementing new features THEN developers SHALL use the centralized GraphQL utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript support for GraphQL operations, so that the code is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing GraphQL queries THEN the system SHALL provide proper TypeScript types for responses
2. WHEN implementing mutations THEN the system SHALL validate input types at compile time
3. WHEN using GraphQL data THEN the system SHALL have full IntelliSense support
4. WHEN refactoring code THEN TypeScript SHALL catch breaking changes in GraphQL operations
5. WHEN generating types THEN the system SHALL automatically update types based on GraphQL schema

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for GraphQL operations, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GraphQL errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN network issues happen THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN developers SHALL have access to GraphQL operation logs
